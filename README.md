# DeServe Protocol

DeServe Protocol - created for the Solana Grizzlython Hackathon

DeServe is a decentralized protocol built on the Solana blockchain. It aims to decentralize a 
variety of services and industries by eliminating middlemen/platform fees and making services 
more transparent.

With its decentralized nature, DeServe eliminates intermediaries, and their associated fees, 
while providing a more direct and transparent means of carrying out transactions. This approach 
creates a fairer and more accessible system that can be leveraged by individuals and businesses 
alike, leading to greater efficiency, lower costs, and more opportunities.
